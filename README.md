HTTP media cache server. Most caching servers does not understand when a media file is being proxied. When storing media files you can gain an performance and space advantage when consider the fact that most of the big meda files are not actually watched from end to end.

We intend to implement a caching algorithm which takes all this into consideration and delivers better cache performance and throughput.
