# TODO

## Now

* CacheLoader to load cache from disk on startup

## Future
* cache.Stats should be separate interface from the cache.CacheManager
* Understand cache control HTTP headers
* Expiring from the cache
* Output/Input filter modules
* Main request logic handling should be modular as well
* Support multiple bytes ranges header (Range: 0-100, 200-300)
* Parsing more complex values for bytes sizes in config
